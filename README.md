# react-landing-page-qstation

A frontend React project using Tailwind CSS. A simple landing page for a reimagined website of the bootcamp that I attended.

I used this as an opportunity to sharpen my React skills, and to learn Tailwind. There could be some improvements, namely using props in some places instead of copying the same code a few times.

## How to run on your local machine:

1. Clone or Download repository
2. Open folder in your IDE/Editor
3. Open terminal, ``` npm install ```
4. ``` cd my-react-website ```
5. ``` npm install ```
6. ``` npm start ```

Ð¢hat's it!
