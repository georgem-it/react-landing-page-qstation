# Landing page made with React and Tailwind

Short Landing Page Demo:

A frontend React project using Tailwind CSS. A simple landing page for a reimagined website of the bootcamp (named QStation) that I attended.

I used this as an opportunity to sharpen my React skills, and to learn Tailwind. I'm improving the code as i learn; for example, I refactored my code by making a new component, named IndividualCard, and implementing destructured props so as not to copy-paste the same element (card, in this case) 3 times in a row, but use props instead.

I also used a package called react typed to animate the text in the hero part of the page.

## How to run on your local machine:

1. Download repository
2. Open folder in your IDE/Editor
3. Open terminal, ``` npm install ```
4. ``` cd my-react-website ```
5. ``` npm install ```
6. ``` npm start ```

Ð¢hat's it!
